-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## __cylc-6.11.4 (2017-01-26)__

More bug fixes backported from early Cylc-7 releases.

[#2120](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2120): fixed remote job kill after a
+suite definition reload, for task proxies that exist at the time of the reload.

[#2111](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2111): fixed member-expansion of
complex `(FAMILY:fail-any & FAMILYI:finish-all)` graph triggers.

[#2102](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2102): fixed validation of mixed
deprecated and new suite.rc syntax.

[#2098](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2098): fixed a problem with task host
and owner task proxies reloaded at suite restart (could cause job poll and
kill to fail in some cases, for tasks in this category).


## __cylc-6.11.3 (2016-12-21)__

One minor bug fix on top of 6.11.2.

[#2091](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2091): Since 6.11.0 use of cylc-5
special "cold start tasks" caused downstream tasks to become immortal. This
fixes the problem, but note that you should no longer be using this deprecated
feature (which will be removed from cylc-7).


## __cylc-6.11.2 (2016-10-19)__

Some minor enhancements and fixes.

### Highlighted Changes

[#2034](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2034): Allow restart from checkpoints.
These are currently created before and after reloads, and on restart. (Note that 
since 6.11.0 suite state dump files no longer exist).

[#2047](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2047): Documented the new
"[scheduling]spawn to max active cycle points" suite configuration item,
which allows successive instances of the same task to run out of order if the
opportunity arises. 

[#2048](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2048): Allow "view prerequisites" for
tasks in the 'runahead' state.

[#2025](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2025): Provide a configurable event
mail footer (suite or site/user configuration).

[#2032](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2032): <code>cylc gui</code> -
removed the annoying warning dialog for connection failed. Take note of the
connection countdown in the status bar instead.

### Other Changes

[#2016](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2016): Fixed a Python traceback
occasionally generated by the gcylc GUI log view window.

[#2018](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2018): Restored the incremental
printing of dots to stdout from the <code>cylc suite-state</code> polling
command (lost at 6.11.1).

[#2014](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2014): Fixed "remove after spawning".
Since 6.9.0 this would not force-spawn the successor of a waiting task.

[#2031](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2031): <code>cylc gscan</code> -
fixed occasional jumping status icons introduced in 6.11.1.

[#2040](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2040): Corrected documentation for
the <code>cylc cat-log</code> command (it was using the alias <code>cylc
log</code>).


## __cylc-6.11.1 (2016-09-22)__

Three minor bug fixes on top of 6.11.0:

[#2002](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2002): fix a bug in the graph string 
parser - if a task appears both with and without a cycle point offset in the 
same conditional trigger expression (unlikely, but possible!)

[#2007](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2007): fix handling of OS Error if
the user run into the limit for number of forked processes.

[#2008](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2008): fix occasional traceback from
`cylc gsan`.


## __cylc-6.11.0 (2016-09-13)__

**This is the last Cylc-6 major release.**  Cylc-7 bug fixes will be
back-ported to 6.11.x for some time to come, however, for those who have not
transitioned to Cylc-7 yet.**

### Highlighted Changes

[#1953](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1953): Parameterized tasks: generate
tasks automatically without using messy Jinja2 loops.

[#1929](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1929): Under `[runtime]`:
 * New task `[[[job]]]` sub-sections unify the various batch system, job
   execution, and job polling settings (older settings deprecated).
 * A new `[[[job]]] execution time limit` setting allows cylc to:
    * automatically generate batch system time limit directives;
    * run background or at jobs with the `timeout` command;
    * poll job with configurable delays (default 1, 3, 10 minutes) after
      reaching the time limit.
 * Moved the content of the old `[event hooks]` section to a unified `[events]`
   section (older settings deprecated).

[#1884](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1884): `cylc gscan` displays a new
warning icon with a tool-tip summary of recent task failures.

[#1877](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1877): The `gcylc` status bar now
shows a countdown to the next suite connection attempt, and resets the
connection timer schedule if the user changes view settings.

[#1966](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1966): Optionally spawn waiting tasks
out to "max active cycle points" instead of one cycle point ahead. This means
successive instances of the same task can run out of order (dependencies
allowing).  Use with caution on large suites with a lot of runahead.

[#1940](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1940): Bash tab completion for cylc
commands.

### Other Changes

[#1585](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1585): If a suite stalls, report any
unsatisified task prerequisites that cannot be met.

[#1944](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1944): `cylc get-config` now returns
a valid suite definition.

[#1875](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1875): Enabled multiple selection in
the gcylc text tree view.

[#1900](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1900): Automatically continue graph
string lines that end in (or start with) a dependency arrow.

[#1862](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1862): New notation for initial and
final cycle point in graph cycling section headings.  E.g. `[[[R1/^+PT1H]]]`
means "run once, one hour after the initial cycle point"; `[[[R1/$-PT1H]]]`
means "run once, one hour before the final cycle point".

[#1928](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1928): New notation for excluding a
cycle point from a recurrence expression, e.g. `[[[T00!^]]]` means 
"daily at T00 after but not including the initial cycle point".

[#1958](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1958): Suite daemon logging upgrade:
improved log file formatting; the log, out, and err files are now rolled over
together as soon as any one reaches the size limit.

[#1827](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1827): Suite state dump files no
longer exist - the suite run DB now records all restart information.

[#1912](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1912): Fixed coloured `cylc scan -c`
output (broken at 6.10.1).

[#1921](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1921): Don't ignore dependencies
among tasks back-inserted prior to a warm-start cycle point.

[#1910](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1910): Task job scripts now use `set
-o pipefail` to ensure that failure of any part of a shell pipeline causes a
job failure.

[#1886](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1886): When a job is submitted for
the first time, any job logs with higher submit numbers will be removed (
these must have been generated by a previous suite run).

[#1946](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1946): Removed annoying warnings
that "self-suicide is not recommended".

[#1889](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1889): Record any unhandled task
messages (e.g. general progress messages) in the suite DB.

[#1899](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1899): Custom task output messages
(for message triggers) are now automatically faked in dummy mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## __cylc-6.10.2 (2016-06-02)__

### Highlighted Changes

[#1848](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1848): Automatic stalled-suite
detection, a "stalled" event hook, and an option to abort (shutdown) if stalled.

[#1850](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1850): Much reduced CPU loading in
cycling suites that have progressed far beyond their initial cycle point (cache
recent points to avoid continually iterating from the start).

[#1836](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1836): New `gscan.rc` file to
configure the initial state of `cylc gpanel` and `cylc gscan` (e.g. which
columns to display).

[#1849](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1849): New configuration options for
the `gcylc` GUI, e.g. to set the initial window size.


### Other Changes

[#1863](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1863): Report tasks added or removed
by a suite reload.

[#1844](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1844): Allow client commands from
another suite's task (these would previously load the passphrase for the parent
suite rather than the target suite).

[#1866](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1866): Allow explicitly unset
intervals in cylc config files, e.g. `execution timeout = # (nothing)`.

[#1863](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1863): Fixed a recent bug (since in
6.10.0) causing shutdown on reload of a suite after removing a task and its
runtime definition.

[#1864](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/): Stronger checks to prevent users 
starting a second instance of a suite that is already running.

[#1869](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1869): Fixed day-of-week cycling.

[#1858](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1858): Fixed a recent bug (since
6.10.1) that could prevent a task at suite start-up from submitting even though
its prerequisites were satisfied.

[#1855](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1855): Allow inserted tasks to be
released to the `waiting` immediately, even if the suite is currently quiet.

[#1854](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/): Restore wildcards to allow 
insertion of multiple tasks at once (inadvertently disallowed at 6.10.0). 

[#1853](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1853): Fixed a recent bug (since
6.10.1): reset task outputs to incomplete on manually retriggering or resetting
to a pre-run state.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## __cylc-6.10.1 (2016-05-17)__

### Highlighted Changes

[#1839](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1839): `gcylc` - fix for occasional
locked-up blank GUI window at start-up (since 6.8.0, Jan 2016).

[#1841](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1841): `gcylc` tree view - fix for
excessive CPU load when displaying large suites (since 6.10.0).

[#1838](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1838): Fix for the suite timeout
event timer not resetting on task activity (since 6.10.0).

### Other Changes

[#1835](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1835): Suite reload - reload all
tasks at once (previously, current active tasks were reloaded only when they
finished, which could result in reloads appearing to take a long time).

[#1833](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1833): `gcylc` - initial task state
filtering configurable via the  `gcylc.rc` config file.

[#1826](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1826): Prevent tasks becoming immune
to change by suite reload after being orphaned by one reload (i.e. removed from
the suite) then re-inserted after another.

[#1804](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1804): PBS job name length - truncate
to 15 characters by default, but can now be configured in `global.rc` for PBS
13+, which supports longer names.
