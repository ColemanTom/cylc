# Test persistence of xtrigger results across restart. A cycling task depends
# on a non cycle-point dependent custom xtrigger called "faker". In the first
# cycle point the xtrigger succeeds and returns a result, then a task shuts
# the workflow down.  Then we replace the custom xtrigger function with one that
# will fail if called again - which should not happen because the original
# result should be remembered (as this xtrigger is not cycle point dependent).
# Also test the correct result is broadcast to the dependent task before and
# after workflow restart.
