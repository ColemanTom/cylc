<a name="6.7.1"/>
    <h2>6.7.1</h2>

    <h3>6.7.1 fixes</h3>
		<ul>
				<li> Avoid remote "tail" processes left behind by the GUI remote job
				log viewer (since 6.7.0).
				<li> gcylc GUI - fixed a bug that under heavy load conditions could
				lead to warning dialogs (non-fatal) associated with stopping the
				progress bar.
				<li> Use remote job log retrieval retries as configured.
				<li> Fixed a problem (since 6.7.0) with updating CYLC_DIR for remote
				hosts.
				<li> Fixed a problem that could affect the ignoring of pre-initial
				triggers (i.e. of dependence on tasks prior to the initial cycle point)
				in conditional trigger expressions.
				<li> Better error messages, for bad suite visualization config and bad
				use of the "cylc cat-log" command.
    </ul>
 
<a name="6.7.0"/>
    <h2>6.7.0</h2>

    <h3>6.7.0 enhancements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Suite identity requests from <code>cylc scan</code> and <code>cylc
        gscan</code> are now only logged in debug mode, or in aggregrate if
        exceeding 1 connection per second over an hour.
        <li> Suite database interaction further optimized to speed up elapsed
        times for fast-running suites.
        <li> Built-in task event handlers are now grouped where possible - e.g.
        to generate a single email for multiple task failures; and to group
        rsync commands by host for remote job log retrieval.
        <li> Job submit, job poll, and job kill actions are now grouped by
        user@host
        <li> 'background' job submission now detaches with <code>nohup</code> -
                this should prevent creation of zombie processes (but it may
                prevent use of 'background' jobs on remote hosts that don't
                permit non terminal-attached processes on login nodes - submit
                jobs to 'at' or your batch scheduler instead). 
        <li> Polling a task now returns custom "message outputs" as well as job
        status.
        <li> <code>gcylc</code> can now tail-follow remote job log files.
        <li> If your batch scheduler - e.g. PBS - hides the final job logs
        until completion, <code>gcylc</code> and <code>cylc cat-log</code> can
        now be configured to view job out and err files using special commands
        while the job is running.
        <li> Allow suite-state polling even if the target suite database does
        not exist yet.
        <li> Improved reporting of Jinja2 errors.
        <li> The <code>cylc gscan</code> GUI (a.k.a. <code>cylc
            gsummary</code>) can now display most of the information now
        available from <code>cylc scan</code> (and more to come).
        <li> Prompt for confirmation before actioning a job kill.
        <li> New gcylc.rc configuration option to start <code>gcylc</code> with
        side-by-side suite views.
    </ul>
 
    <h3>6.7.0 fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Fixed a bug that could cause a KeyError in the gcylc text tree
        view.
        <li> Corrected emacs cylc-mode installation instructions.
        <li> Prevented a gcylc abort caused by clicking on the task state
        filtering icon before any suite is connected.
        <li> Corrected our (new-ish) support for <b>moab</b> job submission.
        <li> Prevent occasional job submissions after a suite shutdown is
        ordered.
    </ul>
 
<a name="6.6.1"/>
    <h2>6.6.1</h2>

    <h3>6.6.1 fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> At sites using ssh task messaging, 
        prevent fall-through to Pyro RPC messaging after successful ssh
        messaging (this would cause error messages in task output since
        cylc-6.5.0, if using ssh messaging)
        <li> Clearer error messages for invalid <code>cylc broadcast</code>
        commands.
        <li> Allow suite and global config files to have different
        date-time syntax (pre and post ISO-8601) for time intervals.
    </ul>
 
<a name="6.6.0"/>
    <h2>6.6.0</h2>

    <h3>6.6.0 enhancements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Finer-grained authentication to suite daemons:</b>
        <ul>
            <li> All suites now reveal identity (name and owner) publicly.
            <li> Public access can also be granted, via suite or global config,
            to suite titles and descriptions, state total summaries, full
            read-only information, and shutdown priveleges.
            <li> Possession of the suite passphrase is still required for full
            control access (in the future, suite passphrases will be replaced
            with proper user accounts in some form).
        </ul>
        <li> <b>Improved <code>cylc scan</code></b>: for all 6.6.0+ suites on
        scanned hosts, scanning is faster, and suite identity can be printed
        along with any other information revealed pubicly including state total
        summaries.
        <li> <b>Edit run (<code>cylc trigger --edit</code>) now prompts
        for confirmation</b> before triggering the edited task.
        <li> <b>Reduced memory use</b> by up to a factor of 2: default task runtime
        settings are now shared instead of duplicated across tasks.
        <li> <code>cylc gsummary</code> columns are now resizable again.
        <li> <b>Bad global config files are no longer silently ignored</b>: a
        bad site file (which users can't change) is ignored with a warning, and
        a bad user config file causes cylc to abort.
        <li> Message outputs are no longer automatically completed when a task
        finishes, so <b>different message outputs can now be used to trigger
            different workflows</b>.
        <li> <b>Task event hook defaults</b> can now be set in global (site,
        user) config files (as for suite event hooks in 6.5.0).
        <li> Added a new example to the User Guide "Advanced Cycling" section,
        on how to run R1 tasks in the final cycle point.
    </ul>

    <h3>6.6.0 fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Fail validation if the suite cycle point format is not
        sufficiently fine-grained for the suite's cycling sequences (e.g.
        if you try to do daily cycling with cycle point format truncated
        to month (%Y-%m).
        <li> Fixed a rare bug that could cause a suite daemon to crash due
        if a new broadcast command was actioned at the same time as the suite 
        was writing broadcast settings to the state dump.
        <li> Fixed insertion of a task family into a suite, broken at 6.5.0.
    </ul>


<a name="6.5.0"/>
    <h2>6.5.0</h2>

    <h3>6.5.0 enhancements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Detect and fail cyclic graphs.

        <li> Set the default process pool size to 4, rather than number of
        cores on the suite host (global config).

        <li> General external event triggers: tasks can be triggered by
        external events as well as by other tasks and the wall clock. The
        external triggering system only needs to know the suite and host name.

        <li> Log the origin of all suite commands: username, host, client
        program name and UUID.

        <li> Expiring tasks - tasks that become ready to run too far behind the
        wall clock (this is optional and configurable) can be made to enter the
        'expired' state and not submit their job.  Other tasks can trigger off
        the expired state.

        <li> General task event handlers: specify handlers and a list of events
        to call them on. This is in addition to current event-specific handler
        config. Built-in:
        <ul>
            <li> Remote task job logs retrieval.
            <li> Task event email.
            <li> Task event handler can now be script templates.
        </ul>

        <li> Event handlers can now retry on failure.

        <li> Allow setting of suite event hooks (under <code>[cylc]</code>) in
        global (site/user) config.
        <li> gcylc
        <ul>
            <li> active progress bars during suite initialisation, reload, and shutdown.
            <li> tree view - task completion progress bars based on mean run times.
        </ul>
        <li> Configurable suite hold time.
        <li> More information logged during suite reloads.
        <li> Lock-breaking recovery mechanism for a public suite database.
        locked by an external process.
        <li>  <code>cylc suite-state</code> - allow use of
        <code>$CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT</code> and cycle point offsets.
        <li> gcylc graph view - suite daemon caches graph edges for better
        performance.
        <li> <code>cylc stop --kill</code>
        <ul>
            <li> if a job kill fails, poll the job to see if it was
            hard-killed externally
            <li> shut down the suite even if the job still exists but cannot be
            killed.
        </ul>
    </ul>


    <h3>6.5.0 fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Allow custom Jinja2 filter module names ending in 'y' or 'p'.
        <li> Fixed "Stopping at None" gcylc status bar message for suites
        restarted with no final cycle point.
        <li> Disallow attempted use of both runhead limiting mechanisms at once
        (the older <code>runahead limit</code> and newer <code>max active cycle
            points</code>).
        <li> Fixed errors in gcylc and monitor due to attempted connection during
        suite initialization.
				<li> Fixed a bug in the cylc-6.4.1 job kill mechanism: it reported "job
				killed failed" even on a successful kill. A killed 'running' task would
				still enter the 'failed' state due to task runtime error trapping, but
				a killed 'submitted' task would stay in the 'submitted' state.
    </ul>


<a name="6.4.1"/>
    <h2>6.4.1</h2>

    <h3>6.4.1 enhancements</h3>
    <ul>

    <li> Suite and task URLs, browseable from <code>gcylc</code> and <code>cylc
        doc</code>.

    <li> Suite "scripting" items can be shortened: <code>command
        scripting</code> to <code>script</code>; <code>post-command
        scripting</code> to <code>post-script</code>; etc.

    <li> Filtering of graph nodes by <code>cylc graph --filter</code>.

    <li> <code>cylc graph</code> and <code>gcylc</code> graph view: nodes that
    are filtered out are now grouped and replaced by dotted "scissor nodes"
    rather than breaking the graph into separate chunks.

    <li> <code>gcylc</code> text tree view,
    <ul>
        <li> display job submit number, retry number, and retry delay interval,
        in the "latest message" column.
        <li> display [user@]host and batch system name even after job submission
        failure.
        <li> report failure of poll and kill commands (e.g. due to task host down) in
        the "latest message" column.
    </ul>

    <li> Improved documentation of suite share and task work directory location
    and use.

    <li> Better error message for job submission failure due to choice of a
    batch system that is not available on the task host.

    <li> Documented use of global (site and user) job-init scripts.
    </ul>


    <h3>6.4.1 fixes</h3>
    <ul>

    <li> Validate final cycle point after command line override (if supplied), not before.

    <li> Prevent <code>cylc gsummary</code> crashing if it can't get state
    info from a suite because (for e.g.) the suite run directory has been
    deleted.

    <li> Don't let <code>cylc broadcast</code> to an invalid cycle point bring
    down the suite.

    <li> Clock-triggering syntax: allow the time offset to be omitted
    completely if no offset is required.

    <li> Better error message for a probable missing R1 graph section, if an
    initial cycle time is given for a non-cycling graph.

    <li> Prevent a DatabaseIntegrityError warning when an old task is
    re-inserted into a suite.

    <li> Corrected some command documentation for the poll, kill, hold,
    release, and reset commands.

    <li> <code>gcylc</code> graph view: fixed filtering of family base nodes.

    <li> Fixed broadcast of float values (e.g. timeout settings).

    <li> Fail validation of mismatched parentheses in the graph.
    </ul>


<a name="6.4.0"/>
    <h2>6.4.0</h2>

    <h3>6.4.0 enhancements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Initial and final cycle point constraints, e.g. <code>initial
            cycle point constraints = T00, T12</code> (initial cycle
        point must end in 00 or 12 hours).
        <li> New <code>min()</code> syntax for graph recurrence expressions,
        e.g. <code>[[[R1/min(T00,T12)]]]</code> (run once at the first
        cycle point ending in 00 or 12 hours).
        <li> gcylc - warn of GUI vs suite daemon version mismatch.
        <li> gcylc - moved the task filter controls to a dialog box, with
        summary state and activation point on the info bar.
        <li> Allow tasks in the runahead pool to be monitored.
        <li> Documented the new edit-run feature.
        <li> Improved output from the <code>cylc broadcast</code> command,
        including error on invalid requests.
        <li> Add IBM Platform LSF batch submission support.
        <li> Allow relative final cycle point in visualisation settings.
    </ul>

    <h3>6.4.0 fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Initialize gcylc task log viewer with the correct log file.
        <li> Activate initial gcylc task filtering immediately at start-up.
        <li> Fixed <code>cylc show</code> for suite title and description.
        <li> Fixed a bug in handling of <code>R/[interval]/[stop-point]</code> recurrences.
        <li> Fail validation of <code>max active cycle points = 0</code>.
        <li> Allow suite restart, with a warning, if a host with active tasks
        is now unavailable.
        <li> Detect and fail use of '&amp;&amp;' instead of '&amp;' in the
        graph.
        <li> Fail <code>at</code> job submission if <code>atd</code> is not
        running.
        <li> If gcylc is connected to a remote suite, allow it to view the logs
        of tasks on the (remote) suite host.
    </ul>

<a name="6.3.1"/>
    <h2>6.3.1</h2>
      <ul>
            <li> Support use of conditional dependencies involving the initial
            cycle point.
            <li> Create missing parts of the suite run directory tree if
            necessary, on restart.
            <li> Propagate <code>CYLC_VERSION</code> prior to remote command
            invocation so that new features can be used on remote hosts even
            if the new version of cylc is not yet the default version (so long as
            it is installed under the standard version wrapper framework, of
            course).
            <li> Start the gcylc graph view in centered mode.
            <li> For the new <em>edit runs</em> introduced in 6.3.0 record a diff
            relative to the pristine job script, in the task log directory.
        </ul>

<a name="6.3.0"/>
    <h2>6.3.0</h2>

    <h3>6.3.0 enhancements</h3>
       <ul>
          <li> Support <em>edit run</em> functionality:
          <code>cylc trigger --edit</code> or
          right-click on a task in the GUI to edit the task job script
          just before manual triggering.
          <li> Support "hold after cycle point" via the run, restart, and hold
          commands.
          <li> New utility to compare suite graphs <code>cylc
              graph-diff</code>.
          <li> If a suite run database lock is encountered and does not
          resolve in the allowed time (unlikely but possible) cylc now writes
          any un-executed db operations to disk before shutdown and loads them
          on restart to prevent an incomplete database.
      </ul>

    <h3>6.3.0 fixes</h3>
      <ul>
          <li> Fixed blank graph views that could result from rerunning a
          suite from an existing GUI instance.
          <li> Hold tasks that are killed manually, to prevent an immediate
          retry (if retries are configured).
          <li> Ensure that polling a SLURM job returns the right result even
          if the job is still in SLURM's active job memory.
          <li> Sort the GUI treeview execution time (dT) column, which is
          displayed in ISO 8601 format, by time-value rather than
          alphanumerically.
      </ul>

<a name="6.2.0"/>
    <h2>6.2.0</h2>

    <h3>6.2.0 enhancements</h3>
      <ul>
          <li> Task state and name filtering now applies to all
          <code>gcylc</code> views (previously it was just the text tree view).
          <li> Optimized <code>gcylc</code> tree view updating - it is now
          faster and smoother for very large active suites.
          <li> Sort <code>gcylc</code> tree view date-time columns by date-time
          value rather than as character strings.
          <li> Added an option to <b>poll all active tasks</b> at once (via
          the <code>gcylc</code> menu and the <code>cylc poll</code> command).
          <li> Write parsed suite definitions, date-stamped, to the suite log
          directory, on run, reload, and restart.
          <li> A display-once option for the <code>cylc monitor</code>
          in-terminal suite state display.
          <li> Cleaned up the GUI suite shutdown dialog window.
          <li> Improved error trapping for SLURM jobs.
          <li> Added documentation of special/restricted/cold-start-only
          initial cycle point behaviour, to the user guide.
          <li> Accept ISO 8601 syntax for global configuration of task
          messaging retry intervals.
          <li> Fail validation of tasks with no explicit cycling defined (since
          cylc-6.0.0, cycle point offsets in the graph no longer define
          cycling sequences for a task).
          <li> New <em>extra large</em> dot size option for <code>gcylc</code>
          task state icons (configured via <code>$HOME/.cylc/gcylc.rc</code>).
          <li> Detect and fail circular runtime inheritance.
          <li> Fail validation if a suite's initial cycle point is greater than
          the final.
          <li> Generate "graph movie" frames via a gcylc graph view menu option.
      </ul>

    <h3>6.2.0 fixes</h3>
      <ul>
          <li> Fixed a bug (since 6.0.0) where jobs submitted to a batch
          scheduler would have no output, error, or name directives, if no
          directives were specified in the suite definition.

                <li> In the <code>cylc gsummary</code> GUI, suite state
                summaries can now be expanded to show the summary state for
                each active cycle point.
                <li> A new command <code>cylc get-cylc-version SUITE</code>
                reports the version of cylc running the targetted suite
                daemon.
                <li> Updated some example suites to cylc-6 format.
        </ul>

        <h3>6.1.3 fixes</h3>
      <ul>
            <li> Fixed the <code>suite host self-identification = address</code>
            global config setting (it causes the suite host to be identified
            by IP address rather than host name in task job scripts).
            <li> Allow "-a" in task names (this character combination broke
            graph processing).

        <code>cylc gsummary</code> as configured in site/user config files.
        <li> There are now two suite-run databases: the original is for
        read-only use by external processes; a new one under the suite state
        directory is for private use by the suite daemon.
        <li> Job submission improvements:
        <ul>
            <li> new site/user config item <code>cylc executable</code> allows
            you to explicitly configure the location of cylc on remote hosts.
            <li> job files now site/user configurable via
            <code>$HOME/.cylc/job-init-env.sh</code>,

            <code>$CYLC_DIR/conf/job-init-env-default.sh</code>
            <li> (i.e. we no longer rely on sourcing <code>/etc/profile</code>
            and <code>$HOME/.profile</code> - but still done for back compat)
            <li> job submission is now handled by a cylc command on the task
            host rather than an elaborate shell command generated on the suite
            host
            <li> new site/user config item <code>remote copy template</code>
            for configuration the <code>scp</code> command for copying files to
            remote hosts
            <li> the site/user config items <code>remote shell template</code>
            and <code>use login shell</code> are now used for job submission.
            <li> new site/user config item <code>suite to job
                environment</code>: a list of environment variables to be
            passed from a suite to its jobs.
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.1.0 fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Fixed crash after a reload that removes tasks from the suite

        <li> Fixed display of new tasks in the gcylc dot and text views
        after a suite reload that adds tasks to the suite definition.

        displayed nothing in grouped mode if all nodes were families.
        <li> Fixed backward compatibility for cylc-5 <code>gcylc.rc</code>

        <li> bug fix in Daily cycling - for non-zero hour and step
        greater than one day, the wrong sequence was generated
        <li> bug fix: if no initial cycle time was specified in the
        suite.rc file of a suite with inter-cycle triggers, and a
        cold-start OR construct is not used with the inter-cycle
        triggers, restarting the suite would wipe out the inter-cycle

        <li> bug fix: task job scripts could infrequently be corrupted
        if suite and task host shared a common filesystem
        <li> bug fix: manually retriggering a task now resets its

        <li>The default ordering of tasks and families in the gcylc text
        and dot views is now the order in which they are defined in the
        <code>suite.rc</code> file. 

        <li>Fixed a bug which led to a <code>state</code> file in the
        current working directory being loaded for a suite restart
        instead of the correct state dump under the suite run directory.

    for a hard killed task were logged correctly but did not
    automatically set the task proxy to the 'failed' state.

    <li>Fixed a <code>cylc submit</code> bug affecting 5.4.5 - 5.4.9:
    If used <em>with the suite running at the same time</em> (not
    recommended) the submit command would wipe out the port number in
    the <code>cylc-suite-env</code> file, resulting in tasks losing
    contact with their suite daemon.

        using automatically-generated inter-cycle triggers rather than
        delayed spawning - they now behave "sequentially" under
        all circumstances.
        <li>Delete the port file if suite start-up aborts early on
        <li>A new command, "cylc check-versions SUITE" checks that
        the version of cylc invoked on each of SUITE's task hosts is the
        same as *this* version, or else reports the remote versions.

        poll was initiated.
        <li>Better detect if a task host is the suite host

        run yet (e.g. with use of <code>cylc run --hold</code>)

        <li>Task messaging does not bother retrying if the corresponding
        task proxy has been removed from the suite.

        <li>Suicide triggering is now logged like other triggering
        events.

        their own process groups so that task job kill can get even
        their sub-processes.

        <li>Dependency graphs: fixed an abort caused by use of
        unnecessary brackets around pre-initial-cycle triggers.

        <li>Catch <code>inherit = None</code> in the runtime inheritance
        hierarchy (this is illegal without one or more secondary
        parents).

        <li>Handle unknown task states in the GUI (provides backward

        <li>Changed the <em>submitting</em> task state name to
        <em>ready</em> - meaning the task is ready to run and has been
        passed to the job submission thread in the cylc daemon.

        <li>New User Guide sections under <em>Suite Design Principles:</em>
        <ul>

        <li>New User Guide section - <em>Style Guide</em> 

        <li>Added a command wrapper script, and documentation, to
        facilate use of multiple versions of cylc at once - so you can
        run new suites at new versions of cylc without having to upgrade
        existing long-running suites.

        <li>Handle a known problem with the ext4 filesystem that could wipe
        out cylc state dump files in the event of a power failure. 

        <li>Graceful shutdown on loading a corrupted restart state dump file.

        <li>Use the normal suite run directory for tasks executed by the

        <li>Shut down cleanly if access to the suite run directory is
        lost.

        <li>Fixed graphing of suite start up when several subsequent
        cycles depend on an initial asynchronous task.
    </ul>

<a name="5.4.3"/>
    <h2>5.4.3</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The <code>cylc get-config</code> and <code>cylc
            get-global-config</code> commands now print blank values
        instead of the Pythonic <code>None</code> for unset items. This
        means newly generated user config files are usable immediately
        without modification.

        <li>Sensible suite-dependent defaults are now computed for the
        <code>[visualization]</code> initial and final cycle times:
        from the suite's initial cycle time out to its default runahead
        limit

        <li>For inlined editing of suites with include-files, the
        file inclusion markers are now comments so that the suite
        definition can still be used (validated etc.) during the
        edit session.

        <li>Fixed a recent bug that breaks polling of tasks with
        an explicit 'owner' configured (as opposed to defaulting
        to the suite owner's username, or using <code>.ssh/config</code>
        to translate usernames for remote tasks). This bug would
        break suite restart if any such tasks were present in the
        submitted or running states.
    </ul>


<a name="5.4.2"/>
    <h2>5.4.2</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Fixes a bug that could cause an error in gcylc if it tried
        to interrogate a very large suite before it had finished
        initializing.

        <li>Allow the suite name delimiter '.' (dot) character in
        the names of the new automatic suite-polling tasks.

        <li>Fixed a recently introduced bug that caused the <code>cylc
            db refresh</code> command to crash if a suite's name had
            been changed.

        <li>Fixed gcylc graph view right-click family Group/Ungroup
        behaviour.

        <li>Documented automatic suite-polling tasks (triggering off
        tasks in other suites) in the user guide.

        <li>Updated suite definition syntax documentation in the
        user guide.

        <li>Further expansion of the automated test battery.

    </ul>


<a name="5.4.1"/>
    <h2>5.4.1</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Fixes a bug introduced just before the 5.4.0 release: cylc
        would abort if a task in a suite with no final cycle time hit
        the runahead limit.
       </ul>

<a name="5.4.0"/>
    <h2>5.4.0</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>dependence on tasks before the initial cycle time is now
        ignored, so cold-start tasks are no longer strictly required
        in suites with inter-cycle dependence

        <li>graph notation support for triggering off tasks in other suites

        <li>a comprehensive new User Guide <em>Tutorial</em> section replaces
        the old <em>Quick Start Guide</em> 

        <li>a multi-suite summary gui, <code>cylc gsummary</code>

        <li>a new <code>submit-retry</code> task state (the
        <code>retry</code> state is now exclusively for execution retry)

        <li>processed suite definitions are now written out to the suite directory

        <li>a simpler and more robust suite name registration database
        (to upgrade run <code>cylc upgrade-db</code>)

        <li>many performance enhancements for large suites

        <li>gcylc
        <ul>
            <li> single updater thread for multiple suite views
            <li> updates only if the suite state has changed (lower network traffic)
            <li> optional transposed dot view
            <li> clickable suite error notification in the task bar
            <li> in the graph view, runahead tasks and tasks held beyond
            the suite final cycle time - and potentially many base graph
            nodes to join the graph - are now cropped by default.
        </ul>

        <li>extract specific site/user config items with <code>cylc
        get-global-config</code>

        <li>replaced ConfigObj with a faster custom config file parser and
        validator, "parsec"

        <li>repeated sections and items are now allowed in suite definitions

        <li>task poll and kill for Sun Grid Engine (other job submission
        methods got this at 5.3.0)

        <li><code>cylc cat-log</code> now prints task as well as suite logs

        <li>a greatly expanded automated test battery using a new Perl
        <code>prove</code>-based framework

        <li>support added for the Jinja2 <code>do</code> extension
        (allows manipulation of data structures without having to
        <code>set</code> a variable)

        <li><code>cylc graph</code> now has a "save image" GUI button (previously a
        command line option had to be used to generated image files)

        <li>improved <code>cylc trigger</code> semantics: manual
        triggering now results in immediate job submission if the target
        task does not belong to a limited queue or if it is already
        queued, otherwise it will queue the task immediately.

        <li>stop queued job submissions immediately if a shutdown is
        requested

        <li>deprecated the <code>--owner</code> command option to
        <code>--user</code> and documented more clearly that use of
        this and <code>--host</code> results in command re-invocation on
        the remote account

        <li>if an owner is not specified for a task <code>$USER</code>
        is no longer assumed - this allows remote username translation
        to be done via <code>$HOME/.ssh/config</code>

        <li>many many bug fixes, including:
        <ul>
            <li> the order of cycling graph sections of different kinds (e.g.
            Daily and Monthly in the same suite) no longer matters 

            <li>Monthly cycling now works properly even if the initial
            cycle time is off-sequence

            <li>respect the <code>[visualization]collapsed families</code>
            suite config item for the initial graph view

        </ul>


    </ul>


<a name="5.3.0"/>
    <h2>5.3.0</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>New <code>submit</code> and <code>submit-fail</code> task
        triggers.

        <li>The EVENT argument passed to event handler scripts now
        matches the suite.rc item names exactly (no replacement of
        spaces with underscores, e.g. in "submission timeout".

        <li>Automatic polling as a task communication mechanism for task
        hosts that do not allow return messaging by network socket
        (Pyro) or ssh.

        <li>On-demand job poll and kill by CLI and GUI.

        <li>Automatic job poll on task job submission and execution
        timeouts.

        <li>Automatic job polling on restarting a suite, to find out
        what happened to any orphaned tasks while the suite was
        down.

        <li>Fixed ksh compatibility in task job scripts.

        <li>All gcylc views start in family-grouped mode.

        <li>Optionally ignore suicide triggers in suite graphs and
        the gcylc graph view.

        <li>Delay between job submission batches set to zero by default.

        <li>Option to kill active tasks before shutdown.

        <li>Support for "future triggers": <code>foo[T+24] => bar</code>

        <li>Better spent task proxy clean-up algorithm.

        <li>Allow manual triggering of tasks that are retrying.

    </ul>

<a name="5.2.0"/>
    <h2>5.2.0</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>gcylc can now switch between suites</b> - the
        former <code>cylc dbviewer</code> GUI has been converted to a
        "File Open" dialog for gcylc.

        <li><b>Preparation commands</b> (validate, graph, etc.) can now take
            a suite definition path instead of a registered suite name.

        <li><b>Control commands</b> can now operate on multiple tasks at once,
        selecting by family name or regular expression.

        <li><b>A new task state</b> to distinguish submission failure from
            execution failure.

        <li> Configurable <b>job submission retry</b>.

        <li>A poll-and-wait option for the <b>stop command</b>.

        <li><b>Orphaned running tasks</b> can now reconnect to a
        restarted suite, even if it starts on a different port.

        <li>Automatic suite <b>run-directory housekeeping</b>.

        <li>The final path component of a <b>task work directory</b> can
        now be set in the suite definition. This restores the pre cylc-5
        ability to allow groups of interdependent tasks that all read
        and write from their current working directories to be given a
        common file share space.

        <li>The ssh connection now remains open while <b>remote background
            tasks</b> run, for sites that automatically kill detached
        processes on login nodes.

        <li>Restored <b>dynamic host selection by environment variable</b>.

        <li><b>Suicide triggers</b> can now be applied to task families.

        <li>Interactive <b>command prompts</b> have been disabled by default.

        <li>Dropped support for <b>Python 2.4.</b>

        <li><b>UTC mode</b> now sets <code>$TZ</code> in task environments.

        <li>The <b>test battery</b> now cleans up temporary files after
        itself, and it has been parallelized.

        <li> <b>syntax hilighting</b> for the <b>kate</b> editor.

        <li>Access to the new <b>suite run-db</b> is now retried several
        times in case of an unlikely access conflict.

        <li>A first-parent namespace can now be demoted to prevent its
        use as the visualization family (e.g.
        <code>inherit = None, myparent</code> will keep the namespace
        under root for visualization purposes).

        <li><code>cylc list</code> command output has been updated
        for multiple inheritance, and the option to print namespace
        (task and family) title information has been restored.

        <li>Cylc can now be invoked via symlinked directories in
        <code>$PATH</code>.

    </ul>

<a name="5.1.1"/>
    <h2>5.1.1</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Restored use of visualization settings, broken by
        the task ID delimiter change in 5.0.0.

        <li>Restored <b>image file output</b> capability to the gcylc
        suite graph dialog.
    </ul>

<a name="5.1.0"/>
    <h2>5.1.0</h2>

<ul>

    <li>Added <b>site/user config file documentation</b> to the User
    Guide.

    <li>The <b>task ID delimiter has changed</b> from '%' to '.'
    (foo%2013080800 becomes foo.2013080800) because the '%' character
    causes trouble for web-based suite output viewers. This affects task
    IDs on the command line, and task log filenames, but it does not affect
     suite definitions.

    <li> Updated several example suites that were not validiting after recent changes.

    <li><b>Multiple inheritance</b> for the runtime namespace hierarchy.

    <li><b>A new command</b> <code>cylc [util] suite-state</code> queries the
    new suite run databases for task state, and in a polling mode can be
    used by tasks to wait on tasks in other suites.

    <li>New <b>task job status files</b> in the task job log directory
    are updated by running tasks. In the future this will allow cylc to
    determine, on restarting, what happened to running tasks that were
    orphaned when the suite was down.
</ul>


<a name="5.0.3"/>
    <h2>5.0.3</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Create many fewer temporary directories.</b>
</ul>

<a name="5.0.2"/>
    <h2>5.0.2</h2>

<ul>
    <li> <b>Bug fix for warm starts</b> - a function <code>plog()</code>
    that no longer exists was called on warm starting.

    <li> <b>Bug fixes for doc/Makefile:</b> - "make clean" was not
    working, and a fatal error occured if htlatex was not installed.

</ul>


<a name="5.0.1"/>
    <h2>5.0.1</h2>

<ul>
    <li> <b>Bug fix for 5.0.0 batched job submission:</b> a job
    submission failure would cause cylc to abort.

    <li> <b>Changed "log root" filenames</b> (i.e. task job script plus
    stdout and stderr logs, and <code>$CYLC_TASK_LOG_ROOT</code>
    in task environments): replaced seconds-since-epoch with a simple
    <i>submit number</i> that increments on retries and manual
    triggering.

    <li> Added a suite definition <b>syntax file</b> for the
    <b>gedit</b> editor and other gtksourceview programs:
    <code>conf/cylc.lang</code>.

</ul>

<a name="5.0.0"/>
<h2>5.0.0</h2>

<ul>
    <li> <b>Multi-threading</b>: cylc now does continous request
    handling, batched task job submission, and batched event handler
    execution, in background threads. This has big performance
    benefits for large, busy, suites.

    <li> Cylc now runs in <b>daemon mode</b> - no need to use nohup
    anymore.

    <li> <b>Major change in suite restart behavior</b>: tasks recorded
    in the submitted, running, or failed states are no longer triggered
    automatically on restarting, because that is not always desirable.

    <li> A new command can <b>broadcast runtime settings to tasks in
    a running suite</b>, overriding their configured settings. One way to
    use this: <b>tasks can communicate environment variables to other
        tasks downstream of them</b>.  Broadcast settings persist across
    restarts.

    <li> <b>Reloading the suite definition at run time</b> is now
    supported. Even task definitions can be added and removed without
    stopping and restarting the suite.

    <li> <b>Restarting after deleting task definitions</b> now works
    without modifying the state dump.

    <li> <b>Dynamic host selection</b> is officially supported.

    <li> New <b>family trigger syntax</b> allows any family finish
    semantics, with use of conditional operators.

    <li> Higher level <b>family triggers</b> (families of
    families) can now be used in the graph.

    <li> New <b>site and user config files</b> some former suite
    definition items, and other global settings, can now be configured
    globally.

    <li> The <b>runahead limit</b> now automatically defaults to the
    twice the smallest cycling interval in a suite, and setting it too
    low can no longer stall a suite.

    <li> <b>Self-diagnosing test suites</b> can now be created to test
    that cylc upgrades will not break your systems; see
    "Reference Tests" in the User Guide.

    <li> The <b>suite control GUI "gcontrol" has been renamed
        "gcylc"</b> as it now has suite preparation capability too
    (editing, graphing, validating, etc.); the former "gcylc" GUI is
    still available as <code>cylc dbviewer</code>.

    <li> Configurable <b>gcylc task state color themes</b> common to all
    views.

    <li> The <b>gcylc dot view</b> now has hover-over task state
    information, and right-click menus.

    <li> The <b>gcylc graph view</b> now has:
    <ul>
        <li> <b>family node</b> state coloring and mouse-hover member
        state information
        <li> <b>landscape mode</b>
        <li> <b>reduced redraw</b> (i.e. the graph jumps around less)
        <li> <b>"cycle time focus"</b> now works (broken between 4.2.2 and 4.5.1)
    </ul>
    

    <li> <b>gcylc: less frequent polling</b> for stopped suites, to
    reduce network traffic. A polling reset button can be used to
    reconnect to a restarted suite immediately.

    <li> <b>Undefined Jinja2 variables</b> now cause an abort.

    <li> <b>Set Jinja2 variables on the run command line</b>
    (in-line or by referencing an external file).

    <li> <b>Removed pseudo backward compatibility</b>
    (<code>#!cylc-x.y.z</code>).  We will endeavor
    to provide proper backward compatibility from now on.

    <li> Configurable <b>task messaging retry</b> for resilience to
    network outages etc.

    <li> <b>Task messaging failure</b> no longer causes tasks to abort.

    <li> <b>ssh task messaging</b>: the path to cylc on the suite host
    is now transferred via the task job script (no need to rely on
    login scripts).

    <li> A new <b>task retry event hook</b> is triggered if a task fails
    but has a retry lined up. The <b>task failed event hook</b> is only
    triggered on a final definitive failure.

    <li> Handling <b>HPC job preemption:</b> Tasks can be configured
    to revive from the dead if they start running again after reporting
    failure.

    <li> A new config item to <b>abort a suite if any task fails</b>.

    <li> Removed the requirement to prefix the integer TAG of an
    asynchronous (non-cycling) task, on the command line, with <b>a:</b>.

    <li> Added <b>suite event hooks</b> for suite <b>startup</b> and
    <b>shutdown</b>.

    <li> Replaced the original <b>simulation mode</b> which submitted
    real dummy tasks to run locally with a proper <b>simulation mode</b>
    that does not even submit dummy tasks, and a <b>dummy mode</b>
    that simply dummies out command scripting but leaves job
    submission, hosting, etc. intact.

    <li> Tasks can check <b>$CYLC_TASK_IS_COLDSTART</b> to determine
    whether or not they are cold-start tasks.

    <li> A new <b>strict validation</b> option protects against
    inadvertent creation of naked dummy tasks (tasks with no explicit
    runtime config) by misspelling task names.

    <li> Optional <b>suite host identification by IP address</b> instead
    of host name.

    <li> A suite-specific <b>sqlite database</b> is populated by
    cylc with task event and status information. Planned future uses
    include retrieval of information about long-finished tasks, and
    replacing the current primitive state dump files.

    <li> Allow <b>(number-of-retries)*(delay)</b> notation in task
    <b>task retry</b> configuration.

    <li> The <b>cylc doc</b> command now loads a documentation index in
    your browser.

    <li> Suite <b>block/unblock</b> functionality has been removed.

    <li> Optionally <b>disable use of a login shell</b> in
    passwordless ssh remote command invocation (e.g. to submit
    remote tasks). 

    <li> The task execution environment variables
    <b>$CYLC_SUITE_INITIAL_CYCLE_TIME</b> and
    <b>$CYLC_SUITE_FINAL_CYCLE_TIME</b> now persist across restarts.
