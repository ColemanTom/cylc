<!--l. 5851--><p class="noindent" >Early versions of cylc were focused on developing and testing the new scheduling algorithm, and the suite design
interface at the time was essentially the quickest route to that end. A suite was a collection of &#8220;task definition files&#8221;
that encoded the prerequisites and outputs of each task in a direct reflection of cylc&#8217;s internal task proxies. This way
of defining suites exposed cylc&#8217;s self-organising nature to the user, and it did have some nice properties. For instance
a group of tasks could be transferred directly from one suite to another by simply copying the taskdef files over
(and checking that prerequisite and output messages were consistent with the new suite). However,
ensuring consistency of prerequisites and outputs across a large suite could be tedious; a few edge cases
associated with suite start-up and forecast model restart dependencies were, arguably, difficult to
understand; and the global structure of a suite was not readily apparent until run time (although to
counter this cylc 2.x could generate run-time resolved dependency graphs very quickly in simulation
mode).

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">G.2   </span> <a 
 id="x22-387000G.2"></a>Version 3.0</h4>
<!--l. 5870--><p class="noindent" >Version 3.0 implemented an entirely new suite design interface in which one defines the suite dependency graph,
execution environment, and command scripting for each task, in a single structured, validated, configuration file -
the suite.rc file. This makes suite structure apparent at a glance, and much important detail is now implicitly
implied by the graph.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">G.3   </span> <a 
 id="x22-388000G.3"></a>Version 4.0</h4>
<!--l. 5879--><p class="noindent" >Version 4.0 has the following major improvements over cylc-3.x, along with many refinements:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Suite  registration  was  generalized  from  GROUP:NAME  to  a  hierarchy  of  arbitrary  depth,  e.g
     foo.bar.baz, allowing suites to be organized in a tree-like structure.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The suite.rc file, which was initially somewhat haphazardly structured, was reviewed in great detail
     and clearly organized. In particular it now defines a <span 
class="cmti-10">namespace hierarchy </span>of families and tasks to allow
     common runtime properties to be grouped naturally among related tasks.
                                                                                         

                                                                                         
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The Jinja2 template engine is now supported, adding general programmability to cylc suite definitions.</li></ul>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">G.4   </span> <a

<!--l. 5896--><p class="noindent" >Version 5.0 contains some major internal changes to enhance performance for large suites, such as multi-threading
for continuous request handling and task job submission. We also aim to provide backward compatibility for suite
definitions from version 5.0 onward, wherever possible.
