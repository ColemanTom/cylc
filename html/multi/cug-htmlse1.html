<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >Environmental forecasting suites generate forecast products from a potentially large group of interdependent
scientific models and associated data processing tasks. They are constrained by availability of external driving data:
typically one or more tasks will wait on real time observations and/or model data from an external system, and
these will drive other downstream tasks, and so on. The dependency diagram for a single forecast cycle
in such a system is a <span 
class="cmti-10">Directed Acyclic Graph </span>as shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x2-50011">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-dep-one --></a> (in our terminology, a <span 
class="cmti-10">forecast</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">cycle </span>is comprised of all tasks with a common <span 
class="cmti-10">cycle time</span>, which is the nominal analysis time or start
time of the forecast models in the group). In real time operation processing will consist of a series of
distinct forecast cycles that are each initiated, after a gap, by arrival of the new cycle&#8217;s external driving
data.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   From a job scheduling perspective task execution order in such a system must be carefully controlled in order to
avoid dependency violations. Ideally, each task should be queued for execution at the instant its last prerequisite is
satisfied; this is the best that can be done even if queued tasks are not able to execute immediately because of
resource contention.

 id="x2-30001.2"></a>EcoConnect</h4>
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >Cylc was developed for the EcoConnect Forecasting System at NIWA (National Institute of Water
and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand). EcoConnect takes real time atmospheric and stream flow
observations, and operational global weather forecasts from the Met Office (UK), and uses these to
drive global sea state and regional data assimilating weather models, which in turn drive regional sea
state, storm surge, and catchment river models, plus tide prediction, and a large number of associated
data collection, quality control, preprocessing, post-processing, product generation, and archiving
tasks.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x2-3001f1"></a>
The global sea state forecast runs once daily. The regional weather forecast runs four times daily but it supplies
surface winds and pressure to several downstream models that run only twice daily, and precipitation
accumulations to catchment river models that run on an hourly cycle assimilating real time stream flow
observations and using the most recently available regional weather forecast. EcoConnect runs on
heterogeneous distributed hardware, including a massively parallel supercomputer and several Linux
servers.

<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >Most dependence between tasks applies within a single forecast cycle. Figure&#x00A0;<a

a single forecast cycle, multiple parallel streams of execution that branch when one task generates
output for several downstream tasks, and merge when one task takes input from several upstream
tasks.

<!--l. 136--><p class="indent" >   Now the question arises, what happens if the external driving data for upcoming cycles is available
in advance, as it would be after a significant delay in operations, or when running a historical case
study? While the forecast model <span 
class="cmti-10">a </span>appears to depend only on the external data <span 
class="cmti-10">x </span>at this stage of the
discussion, in fact it would typically also depend on its own previous instance for the model <span 
class="cmti-10">background</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">state </span>used in initializing the new forecast. Thus, as alluded to in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x2-50033">3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-dep-two-linked --></a>, task <span 
class="cmti-10">a </span>could in principle
start as soon as its predecessor has finished. Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x2-50044">4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-overlap --></a> shows, however, that starting a whole new cycle
at this point is dangerous - it results in dependency violations in half of the tasks in the example
suite. In fact the situation could be even worse than this - imagine that task <span 
class="cmti-10">b </span>in the first cycle is
delayed for some reason <span 
class="cmti-10">after </span>the second cycle has been launched. Clearly we must consider handling
inter-cycle dependence explicitly or else agree not to start the next cycle early, as is illustrated in
Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x2-50055">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-job-no-overlap --></a>.
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3.2   </span> <a 
 id="x2-60001.3.2"></a>Inter-cycle Dependence</h5>
<!--l. 157--><p class="noindent" >Forecast models typically depend on their own most recent previous forecast for background state or restart files of
some kind (this is called <span 
class="cmti-10">warm cycling</span>) but there can also be inter-cycle dependence between different tasks. In an
atmospheric forecast analysis suite, for instance, the weather model may generate background states for observation
processing and data-assimilation tasks in the next cycle as well as for the next forecast model run. In real time
operation inter-cycle dependence can be ignored because it is automatically satisfied when one cycle finishes before
the next begins. If it is not ignored it drastically complicates the dependency graph by blurring the clean
boundary between cycles. Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x2-60016">6<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-dep-multi --></a> illustrates the problem for our simple example suite assuming
minimal inter-cycle dependence: the warm cycled models (<span 
class="cmmi-10">a</span>, <span 
class="cmmi-10">b</span>, and <span 
class="cmmi-10">c</span>) each depend on their own previous
instances.
<!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >   For this reason, and because we tend to see forecasting suites in terms of their real time characteristics,
other metaschedulers have ignored inter-cycle dependence and are thus restricted to running entire
cycles in sequence at all times. This does not affect normal real time operation but it can be a serious
impediment when advance availability of external driving data makes it possible, in principle, to run
some tasks from upcoming cycles before the current cycle is finished - as was suggested at the end of
the previous section. This can occur, for instance, after operational delays (late arrival of external
data, system maintenance, etc.) and to an even greater extent in historical case studies and parallel
test suites started behind a real time operation. It can be a serious problem for suites that have little
downtime between forecast cycles and therefore take many cycles to catch up after a delay. Without taking
account of inter-cycle dependence, the best that can be done, in general, is to reduce the gap between
cycles to zero as shown in Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x2-50055">5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-job-no-overlap --></a>. A limited crude overlap of the single cycle job schedule may be
possible for specific task sets but the allowable overlap may change if new tasks are added, and it
is still dangerous: it amounts to running different parts of a dependent system as if they were not
dependent and as such it cannot be guaranteed that some unforeseen delay in one cycle, after the
next cycle has begun, (e.g.&#x00A0;due to resource contention or task failures) won&#8217;t result in dependency
violations.

<!--l. 262--><p class="indent" >   To further illustrate the potential benefits of proper inter-cycle dependency handling, Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x2-60038">8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-time-three --></a> shows an
operational delay of almost one whole cycle in a suite with little downtime between cycles. Above the time axis is

the only safe schedule possible <span 
class="cmti-10">in general </span>when it is ignored. In the former case, even the cycle immediately after the
delay is hardly affected, and subsequent cycles are all on time, whilst in the latter case it takes five full cycles to
catch up to normal real time operation.
<!--l. 276--><p class="indent" >   Similarly, Figure&#x00A0;<a 
href="#x2-60049">9<!--tex4ht:ref: fig-time-two --></a> shows example suite job schedules for an historical case study, or when catching up after a
very long delay; i.e.&#x00A0;when the external driving data are available many cycles in advance. Task <span 
class="cmti-10">a</span>, which as the most
upstream forecast model is likely to be a resource intensive atmosphere or ocean model, has no upstream
dependence on co-temporal tasks and can therefore run continuously, regardless of how much downstream
processing is yet to be completed in its own, or any previous, forecast cycle (actually, task <span 
class="cmti-10">a </span>does
depend on co-temporal task <span 
class="cmti-10">x </span>which waits on the external driving data, but that returns immediately
when the data is available in advance, so the result stands). The other forecast models can also cycle
continuously or with a short gap between, and some post processing tasks, which have no previous-instance
dependence, can run continuously or even overlap (e.g.&#x00A0;<span 
class="cmti-10">e </span>in this case). Thus, even for this very simple
example suite, tasks from three or four different cycles can in principle run simultaneously at any
given time. In fact, if our tasks are able to trigger off internal outputs of upstream tasks, rather than
waiting on full completion, successive instances of the forecast models could overlap as well (because
model restart outputs are generally completed early in the forecast) for an even more efficient job
schedule.

<!--l. 319--><p class="indent" >   Cylc manages a pool of proxy objects that represent the real tasks in a suite. Task proxies know how to run the
real tasks that they represent, and they receive progress messages from the tasks as they run (usually
reports of completed outputs). There is no global cycling mechanism to advance the suite; instead
individual task proxies have their own private cycle time and spawn their own successors when the
time is right. Task proxies are self-contained - they know their own prerequisites and outputs but are
not aware of the wider suite. Inter-cycle dependence is not treated as special, and the task pool can
be populated with tasks with many different cycle times. The task pool is illustrated in Figure&#x00A0;<a
